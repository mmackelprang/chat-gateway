"""Hard rule #2 guard: no fixture may carry a live secret or real identity.

This is a TEST, not a scrub script, and it walks the whole structure rather
than named paths — on 2026-07-29 a path-guess scrub missed a live token in
`configCompleteRedirectUri` and briefly wrote it to disk. Path guessing is the
failure mode; recursion is the fix.
